# Introduction of WeChat MiniProgram Web AR 

This is a WeChat Web AR Demo. On July 5, 2019, WeChat miniprogram supports AR. It has added a new API named "CameraFrameListener".

[CameraFrameListener API](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/api/media/camera/CameraContext.onCameraFrame.html)

We can create AR effects with the new API. This demo demonstrates a color tracker effect by "tracking.js" library. 

The "tracking.js" library brings computer vision algorithms and techniques into browser environment. We can do real-time color tracking, face detection and much more.
